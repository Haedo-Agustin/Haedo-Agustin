# Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Agustin Exequiel Haedo.

I'm a driven programmer and creative problem-solver who loves turning ideas into reliable software. I thrive learning new technologies, refining best practices, and building maintainable, elegant solutions. I enjoy collaborating with teams, communicating clearly, and delivering tangible impact.

What excites me most: web applications, API design, and automating workflows to save time and reduce errors. I've built both solo and team projects that strengthened my skills across the full development lifecycle â€” from prototyping to testing and deployment. I'm actively seeking opportunities to grow and contribute to ambitious, forward-thinking teams.

Highlights
- Self-motivated learner with a pragmatic approach to building production-ready code.
- Strong collaborator who values clean architecture and well-tested features.
- Focused on delivering value quickly while keeping long-term maintainability in mind.
